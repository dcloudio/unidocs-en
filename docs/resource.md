#### 关于各端的管理规则需要耐心学习
#### Patience should be maintained to learn the rules of management at all sides

uni-app并不难学，但我们注意到很多新人在适应各个平台的规则限制时比较急躁。
uni-app is not difficult to learn, but many novices are impatient when adapting to the rules of each platform.

每个端，有每个端的管理规则，这不是uni-app在技术层面上可以抹平的：
Each side has its own management rules, which cannot be compensated by uni-app on a technical level:

- 比如H5端的浏览器有跨域限制；
- For example, the browser at the H5 side is subject to cross-domain restrictions;
- 比如App端，iOS对隐私控制和虚拟支付控制非常严格；
- For example, on the App side, iOS is very strict with privacy control and virtual payment control;
- 如果你的App要使用三方sdk，比如定位、地图、支付、推送...还要遵循他们的规则和限制；
- If a third party SDK needs to be used on your App, such as location, map, payment, push..., their rules and restrictions should be followed;

遇事耐心，不急不躁，虽然这不是成功的唯一要素，但它是你技术路上长远走下去的基础。
Be patient and calm when encountering difficulties. Although this is not the only element of success, it is the basis for your long-term technical journey.
