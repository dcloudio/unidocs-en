uni，读 `you ni`，是统一的意思。
uni, read `you ni`, means unity.

很多人以为小程序是微信先推出的，其实，DCloud才是这个行业的开创者。
Many people think that Mini Programs were first launched by WeChat. In fact, DCloud is the pioneer of this industry.

DCloud于2012年开始研发小程序技术，优化webview的功能和性能，并加入W3C和HTML5中国产业联盟，推出了HBuilder开发工具，为后续产业化做准备。
DCloud began to develop applet technology in 2012 to optimize the function and performance of webview, and joined the W3C and HTML5 China Industry Alliance, and launched the HBuilder development tool to prepare for subsequent industrialization.

2015年，DCloud正式商用了自己的小程序，产品名为“流应用”，它不是`B/S`模式的轻应用，而是能接近原生功能、性能的App，并且即点即用，第一次使用时可以做到边下载边使用。
In 2015, DCloud officially commercialized its own small program, the product name is "streaming application", it is not a light application of `B/S` mode, but an app that can approach native functions and performance, and is click-to-use. It can be downloaded and used at the same time.

为将该技术发扬光大，DCloud将技术标准捐献给工信部旗下的[HTML5中国产业联盟](https://www.html5plus.org/)，并推进各家流量巨头接入该标准，开展小程序业务。
In order to carry forward the technology, DCloud donated the technical standard to the [HTML5 China Industry Alliance] (https://www.html5plus.org/) under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and promoted the access of various traffic giants to the standard to develop small program business.

360手机助手率先接入，在其3.4版本实现应用的秒开运行。
360 Mobile Assistant took the lead to access, and realized the application running in seconds in its 3.4 version.

随后DCloud推动大众点评、携程、京东、有道词典、唯品会等众多开发者为流应用平台提供应用。
Subsequently, DCloud promoted Dianping, Ctrip, JD.com, Youdao Dictionary, Vipshop and many other developers to provide applications for the streaming application platform.

在2015年9月，DCloud推进微信团队开展小程序业务，演示了流应用的秒开应用、扫码获取应用、分享链接获取应用等众多场景案例，以及分享了webview体验优化的经验。
In September 2015, DCloud promoted the WeChat team to carry out the mini program business, demonstrated many scenarios and cases of streaming applications such as instant-opening applications, scanning codes to obtain applications, and sharing links to obtain applications, and shared the experience of webview experience optimization.

微信团队经过分析，于2016年初决定上线小程序业务，但其没有接入联盟标准，而是订制了自己的标准。
After analysis, the WeChat team decided to launch the mini program business in early 2016, but it did not access the alliance standards, but customized its own standards.

DCloud持续在业内普及小程序理念，推进各大流量巨头，包括手机厂商，陆续上线类似小程序/快应用等业务。
DCloud continues to popularize the concept of mini-programs in the industry, and promotes major traffic giants, including mobile phone manufacturers, to launch services such as mini-programs/quick apps one after another.

部分公司接入了联盟标准，但更多公司因利益纷争严重，标准难以统一。
Some companies have access to the alliance standards, but more companies have serious conflicts of interest, and it is difficult to unify the standards.

技术是纯粹的，不应该因为商业利益而分裂。开发者面对如此多的私有标准不是一件正确的事情。
Technology is pure and should not be divided because of commercial interests. It is not the right thing for developers to face so many proprietary standards.

造成混乱的局面非DCloud所愿。于是我们决定开发一个免费开源的框架。
The chaos was not what DCloud wanted. So we decided to develop a free and open source framework.

既然各巨头无法在标准上达成一致，那么就通过这个框架为开发者抹平各平台差异。
Since the giants cannot agree on standards, this framework is used to smooth out the differences between platforms for developers.

这，就是uni-app的由来。
This is the origin of uni-app.

- 因为多年积累，所以DCloud拥有800多万开发者，并不意外
- Because of years of accumulation, it is not surprising that DCloud has more than 8 million developers
- 因为DCloud一直都有小程序的iOS、Android引擎，所以uni-app的App端和小程序端保持高度一致，并不意外
- Because DCloud has always had the iOS and Android engines of the applet, it is not surprising that the App side of uni-app and the applet side are highly consistent
- 因为DCloud在引擎上的持续投入，所以uni-app的App端功能、性能比大多数小程序引擎都优秀，并不意外
- Because of DCloud's continuous investment in the engine, it is not surprising that the App-side functions and performance of uni-app are better than most small program engines
- 因为DCloud对各家小程序太了解了，所以做好抹平各端差异的跨端框架，并不意外
- Because DCloud knows too much about each applet, it is not surprising to do a cross-end framework that smoothes out the differences between each end

现在，uni-app已经是业内最风靡的应用框架，支撑着12亿活跃手机用户的庞大生态。
Now, uni-app is the most popular application framework in the industry, supporting a huge ecosystem of 1.2 billion active mobile phone users.

世界兜兜转转，当你踏出第一步时，随后很多事不会按你的预期发展。但只要你不忘初心，你想要的那个目标，最终会换个方式实现。
The world goes round and round, and when you take the first step, a lot of things don't go the way you expect. But as long as you don't forget your original intention, the goal you want will eventually be achieved in a different way.

DCloud的初心是什么？
What is the original intention of DCloud?

1. **为开发者提供免费、高效的开发工具，让天下没有难做的应用**
1. **Provide developers with free and efficient development tools, so that there are no difficult applications in the world**
2. **改进应用形态，让用户更方便地获取数字服务**
2. **Improve the application form to allow users to obtain digital services more conveniently**

DCloud也再次承诺不会对uni-app、HBuilderX等工具收费，感谢数百万开发者的一路陪伴，也请一直监督我们不忘初心！
DCloud also promises again that it will not charge for uni-app, HBuilderX and other tools. Thanks to millions of developers for their company along the way, please always supervise us and not forget our original intentions!
